### Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

# Io

Some play with the [Io programming language](http://iolanguage.org/) while working through the book, [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X), by Bruce A. Tate.

## To run exercises

_Io version 2017.09.06 was used. See the offical [installation guide](http://iolanguage.org/guide/guide.html#Introduction-Installing)._

Then for example run `io day1/1.io`.
